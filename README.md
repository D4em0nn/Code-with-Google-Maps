#### Team Name - Geogundam
#### Problem Statement - Using Google Maps API for real-time pothole detection and safer navigation
#### Team Leader Email - rriya1_be20@thapar.edu

### A Brief of the Prototype:
  Imagine driving without the jolt of unexpected potholes. With the power of AI, we've developed a system that not only spots these road nuisances but also displays them on a user-friendly map powered by the trusted Google Maps API. And it doesn't stop there â€” we guide drivers with alternative routes for a smoother journey. As we move forward, we truly value and incorporate community insights to continuously enhance our system. Together, we're redefining the standards of comfortable and safe driving.
